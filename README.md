In this study, I developed a reliable machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine using a dataset from Kaggle. Key parameters such as pH, alcohol content, density, and sugar levels were analyzed to determine their influence on wine quality. The dataset was carefully preprocessed, and the model was fine-tuned for optimal performance. The results demonstrated the model's impressive accuracy in predicting wine quality. This research provides a valuable tool for sommeliers and wine enthusiasts to objectively assess red wine quality, while also showcasing the potential of machine learning in beverage analysis and beyond.
